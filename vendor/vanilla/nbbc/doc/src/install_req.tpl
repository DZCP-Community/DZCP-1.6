<p>To use NBBC in your programs, you will need to have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A web server running PHP 4.0.5 or higher, or PHP 5.0 or higher.</li>
<li>Some PHP programming skills (say, skill level 2, where 1 is "newbie" and 5 is "guru").</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it.  NBBC has been tested primarily on Un*x servers running Apache, but should
work fine on any other operating system or web server.  If you want to perform sophisticated
tricks with NBBC, like adding callback tags, or changing the NBBC parsing mechanisms, you
might need a skill level higher than "2", but for basic usage, you really only need basic
skills.</p>
